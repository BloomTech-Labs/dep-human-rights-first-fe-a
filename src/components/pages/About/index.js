          Human Rights First is an independent advocacy and action organization
          that challenges America to live up to its ideals. We believe American
          leadership is essential in the global struggle for human rights, so we
          press the U.S. government and private companies to respect human
          rights and the rule of law. When they fail, we step in to demand
          reform, accountability and justice. Around the world, we work where we
          can best harness American influence to secure core freedoms.
