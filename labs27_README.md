# Human Rights First Police Use of Force Map - Front End

## Description ðŸ‘‡
> **Disclaimer:** This application is currently in Alpha (as of Oct 20, 2020) and is not ready for production. Please use at your own risk as things will change almost daily.

- Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/), an independent advocacy and action organization. We are also developing additional graphics to track and display police brutality trends.
- An application that takes information from data provided by the data science team collecting relevant incidents and data from Twitter, Reddit, and police agencies to display it on the map.
- This app will display various incidents of police use of force on a map that can be filtered by  type of brutality and location with zipcodes and states.

## Deployed App
- https://d.humanrightsfirst.dev/

## âš  Contributing - future features needed/desired for this project:

> Please refer to the highlited parentheses statements throughout this ReadMe for better understanding

- successful connection between Back End and Data Science teams
- successful connection between Back End and Front End teams
- Register/Login functionality added (currenly not functional)
- ability to reset filters
- ability to apply and filter by date range
- ability to filter by source type
- prevent map refresh/reload when filtering data by incident type:
    - instead of state or global variables for the filter function, more research can be done on filtering layers inside of map.addLayer() functions using filter functions mapbox has
    - setting filters is also an options:  https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#setfilter
- make filter for functional with the Graph
    - add more options to the Graph like filtering by state or zipcode or displaying data based off of date range
